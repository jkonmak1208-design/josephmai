## Selected Design Approach: **Modern Academic Minimalism**

I've selected the **Modern Academic Minimalism** approach for your professor portfolio. This design philosophy emphasizes:

- **Professionalism & Trustworthiness:** The deep navy and clean layout establish academic credibility
- **Content Focus:** Generous whitespace ensures your teaching and research take center stage
- **Readability:** Carefully chosen typography (Georgia for headings, Inter for body) optimizes for long-form academic content
- **Accessibility:** High contrast ratios and clear hierarchy support all users
- **Timeless Appeal:** Swiss design principles ensure the site remains relevant for years

The design will feature a left sidebar for navigation, asymmetric content layouts, and subtle interactions that enhance rather than distract from your academic work. This approach is particularly well-suited for academic portfolios as it prioritizes content clarity and professional presentation.
